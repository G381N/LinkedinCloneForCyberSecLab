# LinkedIn Free Premium Claim – Phishing Simulation (Educational)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **phishing simulation** created as part of an academic exercise.  
The idea was to demonstrate how attackers can exploit **trust, urgency, and human psychology** by creating a fake page that looks like a "Free LinkedIn Premium Claim" offer.  

Instead of simply cloning a login page, I designed a page that mimics a promotional offer ("Claim your LinkedIn Premium") and linked it to a phishing framework (e.g., Zphisher). This approach highlights how social engineering and AI tools can make phishing attacks more convincing.  

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project was created strictly for learning purposes and does not aim to perform real-world malicious activity.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To demonstrate how attackers exploit **student expectations** (e.g., free GitHub Copilot, Gemini Pro, Perplexity Premium) by offering fake "premium" claims.  
- To show how **urgency** (e.g., "limited time offer") can manipulate users into clicking links without thinking twice.  
- To highlight how **AI tools** and platforms like Firebase Studio can be misused for phishing page creation.  
- To illustrate how **phishing kits** work in practice — capturing credentials while redirecting users to legitimate sites.

## 🔑 Key Concepts Demonstrated
1. **AI Misuse**  
   - AI makes it easier to design convincing phishing content (realistic text, banners, branding, etc.).  
   - Even non-technical attackers can generate professional-looking pages.  

2. **Targeted Attacks (Social Engineering)**  
   - Students waiting for campus placements are likely to believe "LinkedIn Premium Free" offers.  
   - By studying the target, attackers can craft relevant baits that feel authentic.  

3. **Psychological Manipulation**  
   - Urgency ("Offer valid for the first 200 students") triggers quick action.  
   - Scarcity and FOMO (fear of missing out) lead to lowered caution.  

4. **Credential Harvesting**  
   - On submitting credentials, data is sent to the attacker while the victim is redirected to the real site.  
   - The victim might remain unaware of the breach until later.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Firebase Studio** → Hosting the fake claim page.  
- **Zphisher** → Automating login page cloning and credential capture.  
- **AI Tools** → Assisting in text/image generation to enhance realism.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
- Even technically skilled individuals can be tricked by well-crafted phishing attacks.  
- AI significantly reduces the barrier to entry for cybercriminals.  
- Urgency, familiarity, and trust are powerful tools in the attacker’s arsenal.  
- Understanding phishing helps in **developing awareness and defense strategies**.
